Introduction to CI/CD
What is CICD?

Continuous integration (CI) is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits a change to version control

Continuous delivery (CD) is the process of building, testing, configuring, and deploying from multiple testing or staging environments to a production environment.

 

CI/CD in Synapse
In an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, CI/CD moves all entities from one environment (Development, Acceptance, Production) to another environment. Promoting your workspace to another workspace is a two-part process. First, use an Azure Resource Manager Template (ARM Template) to create or update workspace resources (pools and workspace). Then, migrate artifacts like SQL scripts and notebooks, Spark job definitions, pipelines, datasets, and data flows by using Azure Synapse CI/CD tools in GitHub.

GitHub Repo Integration
Here we are using GitHub Repo for managing CICD and Development codes. Repo URL: https://github.com/RoyalAholdDelhaize/ah-ddp-hammer-synapse - Connect to preview 

 


 

Master Branch: Master is the collaboration branch that is used to merge the code developed by all the developers.

Workspace_publish Branch: Synapse Studio generates the workspace templates and saves them into a branch called workspace_publish.When publishing, Synapse Studio reads this file, looks for the field publishBranch, and saves workspace template files to the specified location. If the branch doesn't exist, Synapse Studio will automatically create it

Feature Branch: This is also known as Working branch. This branch we used for update any feature changes.

Users can also create feature branches by clicking + New Branch in the branch dropdown. Once the new branch pane appears, enter the name of your feature branch and select a branch to base the work off of.

 


 

Workflow file
 

Define a GitHub Actions workflow in a YAML (.yml) file in the /.github/workflows/ path in your repository. The definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

The .yml file has two sections:

Section

Tasks

Authentication

Define a service principal.

Create a GitHub secret.

Deploy

Deploy the workspace artifacts.

CICD Process
 

Create Feature Branch based on Master Branch. Please note that Master branch is the updated branch and running branch in Development Environment. 

Update or make changes in newly created feature branch.

Then, create Pull Request from Synapse workspace Studio.  


 Once the Pull Request approved for approvers, the newly created feature branch and its updated changes will merge to master branch.

 Go to master branch in Synapse Workspace, here you can see the latest changes in master branch. Please verify before publishing.

 Click validate.

 Click Publish

Once its published, Synapse workspace will generate ARM Template to workspace publish branch. 


Then, GitHub action workflow will trigger and deploy to next higher environments.
